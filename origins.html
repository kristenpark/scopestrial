    <h1>Origins</h1>
    <h2>Controversy over Evolution</h2>
    <p>
    Charles Darwin’s <i>The Origin of the Species</i> (1859) and <i>The Descendant of Man</i> (1871) spearheaded the theory of evolution, the idea that all life on Earth descends from simpler lifeforms growing more complex over time. Although corroborated by several sources and accepted by the general scientific community, anti-evolution movements arose.
    <br><br>
    Fundamentalists believed in literal interpretations of the Bible, including the idea that all life on Earth was individually created by a divine authority. This idea directly contradicted the theory of evolution, which described a progressive development of organisms through natural mechanisms. The fundamentalist belief in faith over science led Tennessee State Representative John Washington Butler to push a law banning the teaching of evolution in Tennessee schools into the Tennessee House of Representatives. The “Butler law” was approved by both the House of Representatives and Senate and was actualized on March 21st, 1925. Although Tennessee governor Austin Peay doubted that the law would be enforced, backlash from modernists quickly brought the law into the international view.
    <br><br>
    The modernist movement, which arose in the 1920s, questioned the role of God on Earth, especially considering the atrocities of World War 1, and believed that religion and science could coexist. The American Civil Liberties Union, as part of this modernist movement, decided to challenge the law on grounds of freedom of religion. They feared that if Tennessee’s law went unchallenged, more states would follow suit, banning science in favor of religion. A couple months after the law’s approval, on May 4th, the ACLU sent a newspaper ad asking for a science teacher willing to help challenge this law. 
    </p>
    <h2>Preparation</h2>
    
    <p>
    To bolster their town’s economy, officials of Dayton, Tennessee asked John Scopes, a coach and science teacher, to volunteer himself for the trial. Scopes himself doubted that he had ever taught evolution, although the district textbook discussed it, but he agreed to join the dramatized trial in order to argue against the silencing of academic freedom of speech. 
    <br><br>
    Scopes contacted the ACLU and became the center of a heated debate between fundamentalism and modernism. He had his students rehearse lines so they could attest that he had taught evolution, and ultimately, he was arrested and subject to trial in the Eighteenth Tennessee Circuit Court.
