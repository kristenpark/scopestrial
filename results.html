        The Butler Law, although brought under scrutiny during both trials, was maintained as legal and unrestrictive of freedom of religion, encouraging the fundamentalist movement and for states like Mississippi, Texas, and Arkansas to create their own anti-evolution laws. 
        <br><br>
        However, the Scopes Trial is still noteworthy for bringing evolution to a new global spotlight, and representing the revolutions of the roaring 20’s as old fundamentalist values conflicted with new modernist ones.
        <br><br>
        The trial also brought up the question of the coexistence between religion and science. Since the trial, the debate between Darwinism and creationism has continued to affect American education. Even though Tennessee’s Butler Act was eventually repealed, nearly 50 years after the trial, the conflict brought up during the Scopes Trial has yet to be settled.

        Case in point: Kitzmiller vs Dover Area School District
        <br><br>
        This court case, occurring in 2005, challenged a Pennsylvania school district’s required teaching of intelligent design, a form of creationism, alongside evolution. In this case, intelligent design was removed from the school’s curriculum. However, regardless of the result, the initial inclusion of intelligent design highlights the continued controversy.
