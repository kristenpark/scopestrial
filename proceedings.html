        Prosecutor Stance: John Scopes is in violation of the Butler Law and a discussion of evolution or the law’s constitutionality is unnecessary.

        Defense Stance: The Butler Law violates freedom of speech and freedom of religion
        <br><br>
        The prosecution first called witnesses, including Scopes’ students, to affirm that John Scopes had indeed taught evolution in class and was thereby breaking the law.
        <br>
        The defense countered by highlighting that the Tennessee constitution, and the American one, both emphasized that a law cannot give preference to any religion. In this case, the Butler Law’s focus on Christian creationism was argued to be unconstitutional. To further support this argument, the defense called in 12 witnesses, experts of both science and religion, to show that this religious influence on education was inappropriate and illegal. Additionally, the witnesses emphasized the scientific evidence supporting evolution.

        Unfortunately, Judge Raulston dismissed the testimonies from consideration, citing that the court could only judge Scopes’ guilt rather than the law’s religious undertones. Additionally, Raulston concluded that the law did not favor any religion in banning evolution in schools.
        <br><br>
        Although the defense’s 12 witnesses had been key to their argument, Clarence Darrow was undeterred in his defense of Scopes. The next day of the trial, Darrow boldly asked for prosecuting attorney William Jennings Bryan to be a witness. Bryan’s religious work made him an expert on the topic, so Darrow put Bryan on the spot by asking him whether literal interpretations of the Bible were applicable to reality. Although Darrow’s cross-examination proved the impracticality of literal Biblical interpretations and the requirement of science to understand the world, disapproval by the court’s attorney general and judge led to the dismissal of his testimony.

        His witnesses dismissed, Darrow called for the jury’s decision, and with just 9 minutes of consideration, Scopes was found guilty and charged $100. Appeal to the Tennessee Supreme Court acquitted Scopes on the reason of excessive punishment, but the Butler Law was left unchallenged. The state chief justice then removed Scopes’ accusation, so further appeals to the U.S. Supreme Court were precluded.
